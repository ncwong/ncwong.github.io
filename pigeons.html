<h3>Feral Pigeons</h3>
<p onmouseover="makePink(this)" onmouseout="makeBlack(this)" id="pigeons"> Feral pigeons (Columba livia domestica), also called city doves, city pigeons, or street pigeons,[3][4] are pigeons that are derived from the domestic pigeons that have returned to the wild.[5] The domestic pigeon was originally bred from the wild rock dove, which naturally inhabits sea-cliffs and mountains.[6] Rock (i.e., "wild"), domestic, and feral pigeons are all the same species and will readily interbreed. Feral pigeons find the ledges of buildings to be a substitute for sea cliffs, have become adapted to urban life, and are abundant in towns and cities throughout much of the world.[7] Due to their abilities to create large amounts of excrement and to carry disease, combined with crop and property damage, pigeons are largely considered a nuisance and an invasive species, with steps being taken in many municipalities to lower their numbers or completely eradicate them
